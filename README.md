# social-media-exercise

This is a social media website with all the features you'd expect. Users can create accounts and post content. As well as comment and like posts. There's also a follow feature to follow users.

I built this as an exercise for the course "CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript" offered by Harvard. 

It comprises a lot of stuff. It's mainly built using Python's Django framework. But it also has HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A SQLite database. And as it's such a large project, there's good automated tests there also.
